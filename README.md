Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This collection contains three simple yet engaging Python programs that helped me develop my programming skills and understand fundamental concepts such as user input, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic GUI development.

Projects Included:
Tic Tac Toe
This is a graphical two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using the Tkinter library. Players can enter their names and take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw. The winning combination is visually highlighted, making it easy to see who won. Itâ€™s a great way to practice GUI programming and event handling in Python.

Rock Paper Scissors
A classic hand game implemented in the command line, where you compete against the computer. You select rock, paper, or scissors by typing a number, and the program decides the winner based on the standard rules. This project helped me practice working with conditionals, random number generation, and user input validation.

Password Generator
This program generates a strong, random password based on user preferences. You can specify how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password. After generating the password, the program also gives feedback on its strength, encouraging better password practices. This project was a great way to learn about lists, loops, randomization, and string manipulation.
